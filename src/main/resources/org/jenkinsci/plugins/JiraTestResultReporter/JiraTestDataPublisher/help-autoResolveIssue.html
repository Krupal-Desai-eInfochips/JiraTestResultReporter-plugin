    Automatically apply transition to resolve issues linked to tests, if the test passes.</br>
    <b>Experimental feature:</b>  For now it only looks for the first transition that contains in its name "resolve".
    If it is found, it will be applied, if not, the status of the issue will not change. In future releases this will be
    parametrized.
